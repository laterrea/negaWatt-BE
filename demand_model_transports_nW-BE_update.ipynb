In this study, only navigation is excluded, as it is negligible in Belgium. The **passenger mobility** is expressed in **passenger-kilometers per year** [**pkm/year**] and includes commuting, leisure, and other mobility needs. The **passenger mobility intensity** reports the passenger mobility over the population and is expressed in **passenger-kilometers per person per year** [**pkm/person/year**].\n",

    "To generate passenger mobility statistics for the reference year (2019), we rely on two main sources: (i) the JRC-IDEES database, whose most recent figures date from 2023 [1,2], and (ii) the two most recent Belgian Federal Mobility Surveys, conducted in 2017 and over the period 2024–2025 [3,4]. These two sources are complementary, as the former excludes data related to active modes (walking, cycling), while the latter focuses on daily commuting within Belgium and excludes extra-territorial trips, aviation being the main representative. Although not strictly required to assess the energy consumption of the transport sector, genlte active modes are key components of a transition based on sufficiency. As they help illustrate their contribution to reducing the sector’s energy demand, they are therefore included in this notebook.\n",

This is about -0.1% deviation, which is more than acceptable! But regarding train, the Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport gives 17,357 Gpkm [3] while IDEES gives 10,364 Gpkm [1,2]. This is about -40% deviation.

    "Excluding gentle modes, from 2000 to 2019, the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+780 pkm/person/year* (or +5.5%) [1,2]. This is driven by aviation (intra and extra Europe), which has grown by about *+1160 pkm/person/year* (or +8.1% w.r.t. total mobility intensity), and also due to rail (passenger trains and urban light rails) which has grown by about *+340 pkm/person/year* (or +2.4% w.r.t. total mobility intensity), while road (two-wheeelers, cars and buses) has decreased by about *-720 pkm/person/year* (or -5.0% w.r.t. total mobility intensity) [1,2].\n",
    "For its part, the Federal Planning Bureau, excluding aviation but including active modes, estimates that from 1990 to 2019 the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+1830 pkm/person/year* [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this increase in the mobility intensity fo the past 30 years, we believe this trend can be reversed, notably because of the expansion of teleworking [5], and through a higher share of urban housing and a prioritisation of closer tourist destinations. Population ageing and increased transportation costs should also reduce the mobility intensity [5]. This reversed trend assumption is further supported by the fact that the Federal Planning Bureau estimates that, under unchanged policies and excluding aviation from the projection, mobility intensity could decrease by around *-100 pkm/person/year* by 2040 (approximately −0.7%) [5].<br> \n",
    "In light of this, we project a **-10% reduction** in global mobility intensity by 2050 w.r.t. the 2019 level. This -10% assumption leads to an estimated **14.381 pkm/person/year** by 2050 (*-1.598 pkm/person/year*).\n",
    "We attribute a significant share of this reduction (around half of it) to a decrease in the number of long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible and whose decarbonisation remains uncertain (limited availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), etc.). More details are provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Comment:** This assumption is further supported by the post-COVID-19 recovery of mobility: it took more than five years for the individual annual distance travelled to return to its pre-crisis level (it had dropped by about -30% from 2019 to 2020) [1,2]. This moderate pace of recovery illustrates the feasibility of reducing the individual annual distance travelled.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Comment:** Our -15% reduction is a conservative assumption with respect to the négaWatt 2022-2050 scenario [6] for France, which assumes a 23% reduction. /!\\ Need to check if we can find this -23% in the nW scenario - haven't found it so far /!\\ *\n",

    "By 2019, 58.8% of all passenger-kilometres were made by car while 19.9% were by plane. The remaining 21.3% were shared among public transport, cycling, walking, and other modes. Cars (with an average occupancy rate of 1,2 [3,4]) and aviation together thus accounted for nearly 80% of total passenger-kilometres in 2019. As these modes of transport are also the most energy-intensive and therefore the most greenhouse-gas-emitting, it is essential to promote modal shift whenever possible, and to limit their use when not.<br>\n",
    "Although fossil-fuelled cars are gradually being replaced by battery electric vehicles, we believe that a fair transition should limit reliance on this individual mode of transport. Replacing all internal combustion engine cars with electric cars without any modal shift does not seem desirable for several reasons, the main ones being (i) the pressure on raw materials (some of which are critical and also needed for other clean technologies) and (ii) the very large land footprint of car-based mobility, particularly in urban areas.<br>\n",
    "With regard to aviation, we believe that short-haul flights should shift towards less energy-intensive modes of transport wherever possible. The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) should be prioritised for long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible. Nevertheless, due to the limited availability and potential of SAF, as well as the technological and economic challenges of alternative propulsion systems (batteries, hydrogen, etc.), a reduction in very long-distance travel appears essential to reduce the overall environmental footprint.<br>\n",
    "We therefore set an overall objective of **reducing** the individual demand for **extra-Europe flights** by **-40%**, and of achieving a **modal shift** for **50%** of the **intra-Europe flights** towards **international train services**. Regarding **passenger cars**, we aim at a **modal shift** for **30%** of the **displacements** and an increased adoption of **carpooling**. More details are provided below.\n",

    "    If the total volume of long-haul flights were reduced by -40% by 2050, decreasing to 12,429 Gpkm, then only about 690.500 people could make such a trip, i.e. about 5.5% of the population. \n",
    "    Looked at from another perspective, for the same overall mobility budget, the entire Belgian population could make such a trip roughly once every 18 years, i.e. nearly five times over a lifetime.

In its 'Vision Rail 2040' policy note published in 2022, the Belgian Minister of Mobility, Georges Gilkinet, stated the objective of increasing the modal share of rail from 8% to 15% by 2040 (aviation excluded) [7]. Few quantitative details are provided; however, assuming that conventional rail intensity was 919 pkm/person/year in 2019 [7], doubling the modal share would bring this value to around 1.840 pkm/person/year by 2040. In light of the performance observed in neighbouring countries, this appears achievable through an increase in service supply, without necessarily expanding network density. The projected value of 1.882 pkm/person/year in 2050 for conventional rail is therefore fully consistent with the stated ambition.*\n",

Now that updated JRC statistics are available up to 2021, it’s clear that the 2019 estimates used as a baseline for cars are inaccurate.

    "Road freight decreases from 75% in 2020 to 58% in 2050. The shift away from road is motivated by the need to decarbonize the sector and reduce energy demand. It is disaggregated in two ways:\n",

    "    - **HDVs** (heavy-duty vehicles), which dominate the road freight segment, see a reduction from 73.5% in 2020 to 56.4% in 2050, consistent with the overall decrease in road freight.\n",

    "Both breakdowns refer to the same total share of road freight and cannot be added together. The objective is to reduce long-distance freight, especially that carried by HDVs, which can more easily be shifted to rail or water. LCVs remain dominant for short urban deliveries and are considered to be a constant factor.\n",

They were used to determine the total road freight transport rather than JRC valuesAn assumption was then applied to split the total into LCVs and HDVs. This approach differs from the actual JRC figures.\n",
