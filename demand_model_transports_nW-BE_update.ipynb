These strategies are implemented through several levers, presented below, which guide the transition towards a low-energy transport system.\n",

In this study, only navigation is excluded, as it is negligible in Belgium. The **passenger mobility** is expressed in **passenger-kilometers per year** [**pkm/year**] and includes commuting, leisure, and other mobility needs. The **passenger mobility intensity** reports the passenger mobility over the population and is expressed in **passenger-kilometers per person per year** [**pkm/person/year**].\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate passenger mobility statistics for the reference year (2019), we rely on two main sources: (i) the JRC-IDEES database, whose most recent figures date from 2023 [1,2], and (ii) the two most recent Belgian Federal Mobility Surveys, conducted in 2017 and over the period 2024–2025 [3,4]. These two sources are complementary, as the former excludes data related to active modes (walking, cycling), while the latter focuses on daily commuting within Belgium and excludes extra-territorial trips, aviation being the main representative. Although not strictly required to assess the energy consumption of the transport sector, genlte active modes are key levers in a transition based on sufficiency. As they help illustrate their contribution to reducing the sector’s energy consumtpion, they are therefore included in this notebook.\n",

    "Excluding gentle modes, from 2000 to 2019, the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+780 pkm/person/year*, which is equivalent +5.5% [1,2]. This is driven by aviation (intra and extra Europe), which has grown by about *+1160 pkm/person/year* (or +8.1% w.r.t. total mobility intensity), and also due to rail (passenger trains and urban light rails) which has grown by about *+340 pkm/person/year* (or +2.4% w.r.t. total mobility intensity), while road (two-wheeelers, cars and buses) has decreased by about *-720 pkm/person/year* (or -5.0% w.r.t. total mobility intensity) [1,2].\n",
    "For its part, the Federal Planning Bureau, excluding aviation but including active modes, estimates that from 1990 to 2019 the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+1830 pkm/person/year* [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this increase in the mobility intensity for the past 30 years, we believe this trend can be reversed, notably because of the expansion of teleworking [5], and through a higher share of urban housing and a prioritisation of closer tourist destinations. Population ageing and increased transportation costs should also reduce the mobility intensity [5]. This reversed trend assumption is further supported by the fact that the Federal Planning Bureau estimates that, under unchanged policies and excluding aviation from the projection, mobility intensity could decrease by around *-100 pkm/person/year* by 2040 (approximately −0.7%) [5].<br> \n",
    "In light of this, we project a **-10% reduction** in global **mobility intensity** by **2050** w.r.t. the 2019 level. This -10% assumption leads to an estimated **14.381 pkm/person/year** by 2050 (*-1.598 pkm/person/year*).\n",
    "We attribute a significant share of this reduction (around half of it) to a decrease in the number of long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible and whose decarbonisation remains uncertain (limited availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), etc.). More details are provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Comment:** This -10% assumption is further supported by the post-COVID-19 recovery of mobility: it took more than five years for the mobility intensity to return to its pre-crisis level (it had dropped by about -30% from 2019 to 2020) [1,2]. This moderate pace of recovery illustrates the feasibility of reducing the individual annual distance travelled.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Comment:** Our -10% reduction is a conservative assumption with respect to the négaWatt 2022-2050 scenario [6] for France, which assumes a 23% reduction.<br/>\n",
    "> /!\\ Need to check if we can find this -23% in the nW scenario - haven't found it so far /!\\ *\n",

    "By 2019, 58.8% of all passenger-kilometres were made by car while 19.9% were by plane. The remaining 21.3% were shared among public transport, cycling, walking, and other modes. Cars (with an average occupancy rate of 1,2 [3,4]) and aviation together thus accounted for nearly 80% of total passenger-kilometres in 2019. As these modes of transport are also the most energy-intensive and therefore the most greenhouse-gas-emitting, it is essential to promote modal shift whenever possible, and to limit their use when not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although fossil-fuelled cars are gradually being replaced by battery electric vehicles, we believe that a fair transition should limit reliance on this individual mode of transport. Replacing all internal combustion engine cars with electric cars and without any modal shift does not seem desirable for several reasons, the main ones being (i) the pressure on raw materials (some of which are critical and also needed for other clean technologies) and (ii) the very large land footprint of car-based mobility, particularly in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to aviation, we believe that short-haul flights should shift towards less energy-intensive modes of transport wherever possible. The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) should be prioritised for long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible. Nevertheless, due to the limited availability and potential of SAF, as well as the technological and economic challenges of alternative propulsion systems (batteries, hydrogen, etc.), a reduction in very long-distance travel appears essential to reduce the overall environmental footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore set an overall objective of **reducing** the individual demand for **extra-Europe flights** by **-40%**, and of achieving a **modal shift** for **50%** of the **intra-Europe flights** towards **international train services**. Regarding **passenger cars**, we aim at a **modal shift** for **30%** of the **displacements** and an increased adoption of **carpooling**. More details are provided below.\n",

    "    Assuming a round trip to a destination 9.000 km away (such as Brussels–Shanghai or Brussels–Los Angeles), i.e. 18.000 km in total, and using 2019 data (20.715 Gpkm of long-haul flights [1,2]), we can infer that about 150.0833 people could have made such a trip in that year, i.e. exactly 10% of the population. If the total volume of long-haul flights were reduced by -40% by 2050, decreasing to 12,429 Gpkm, then only about 690.500 people could make such a trip, i.e. about 5.5% of the population. Looked at from another perspective, for the same overall mobility budget, the entire Belgian population could make such a trip roughly once every 18 years, i.e. nearly five times over a lifetime. This target of a 40% reduction in long-haul flights therefore appears both realistic and socially acceptable.\r\n",

Few quantitative details are provided; however, assuming that conventional rail intensity was 919 pkm/person/year in 2019 [7], doubling the modal share would bring this value to around 1.840 pkm/person/year by 2040. In light of the performance observed in neighbouring countries, this appears achievable through an increase in service supply, without necessarily expanding network density. The projected value of 1.882 pkm/person/year in 2050 for conventional rail is therefore fully consistent with the stated ambition.*\n",

The main barrier to fully replacing them with electric traction remains the lack of electrification of just under 10% of the network, mainly around Ghent (Eeklo–Ronse, Ghent–Geraardsbergen, Aalst–Burst) and on the Charleroi–Couvin line. Full electrification of the network appears to be the most appropriate solution for phasing out diesel, even if it is also the most costly one [8]. The limited use of battery-electric trains also appears to be an interesting option when direct electrification is not possible. The hydrogen train option is set aside due to high operational costs. In the scenarios studied by Transport & Mobility Leuven, full electrification could be achieved by 2035, provided that appropriate policies are implemented [8]. We therefore propose to set a target of **100% electrification** by **2035** (direct catenary + battery)."

    "Compared with other transport modes, the options and potential for defossilising aviation are currently far less mature and all the more uncertain. While Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)—which are renewable (bio-based and synthetic) drop-in substitutes for conventional jet fuel—appear to be the most straightforward option, their real global potential remains uncertain, notably due to competing uses (land use, biomass availability, etc.).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The use of e-fuels, such as hydrogen- or ammonia-powered aircraft, is also being considered. These options nevertheless represent a considerable technical challenge, both in terms of adapting propulsion systems and in terms of fuel storage capacity and safety (energy density, flammability risks, toxicity, pollution management, etc.), as well as the required adaptation of airport infrastructure. Although the aviation sector has stated its ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, projects involving alternative propulsion aircraft are facing delays. For example, Airbus’s ZEROe project, which aimed to bring short-haul a hydrogen-powered aircraft with a capacity of 100 passengers and a range of.1,850 km into service by 2035, has recently been postponed by 5 to 10 years, and its budget has been reduced.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Finally, battery-electric aircraft do not appear to be a viable option for defossilising the aviation sector. Ongoing projects rather focus on developing new uses, particularly in and around urban cent\n",
    "\n",
    "In its *Commitment to Fly Net Zero by 2050*, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) states that around 65% of GHG reductions would be achieved through SAF, 13% through electric and hydrogen aircraft, 19% through carbon capture, and 3% through operational efficiency improvements. These 13% attributed to new aircraft technologies therefore represent only a limited contribution, which likely also reflects a lack of confidence in their large-scale deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our scenario, in view of the delays affecting the hydrogen aviation sector, we assume that by 2050 only, **5% of intra-European flights** will be powered by **hydrogen** (representing less than 2% of total flights). The remaining flights are assumed to rely on **liquid fuels** such as kerosene, without requiring significant changes to propulsion systems. The PyPSA model will then autonomously determine the decarbonisation strategy (use of SAF, carbon capture,etres.\r\n"

    "By 2019, 58.8% of all passenger-kilometres were made by car while 19.9% were by plane. The remaining 21.3% were shared among public transport, cycling, walking, and other modes. Cars (with an average occupancy rate of 1,2 [3,4]) and aviation together thus accounted for nearly 80% of total passenger-kilometres in 2019. As these modes of transport are also the most energy-intensive and therefore the most greenhouse-gas-emitting, it is essential to promote modal shift whenever possible, and to limit their use when not.<br>\n",
    "Although fossil-fuelled cars are gradually being replaced by battery electric vehicles, we believe that a fair transition should limit reliance on this individual mode of transport. Replacing all internal combustion engine cars with electric cars without any modal shift does not seem desirable for several reasons, the main ones being (i) the pressure on raw materials (some of which are critical and also needed for other clean technologies) and (ii) the very large land footprint of car-based mobility, particularly in urban areas.<br>\n",
    "With regard to aviation, we believe that short-haul flights should shift towards less energy-intensive modes of transport wherever possible. The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) should be prioritised for long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible. Nevertheless, due to the limited availability and potential of SAF, as well as the technological and economic challenges of alternative propulsion systems (batteries, hydrogen, etc.), a reduction in very long-distance travel appears essential to reduce the overall environmental footprint.<br>\n",
    "We therefore set an overall objective of **reducing** the individual demand for **extra-Europe flights** by **-40%**, and of achieving a **modal shift** for **50%** of the **intra-Europe flights** towards **international train services**. Regarding **passenger cars**, we aim at a **modal shift** for **30%** of the **displacements** and an increased adoption of **carpooling**. More details are provided below."
