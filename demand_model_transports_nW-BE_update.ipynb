In this study, only navigation is excluded, as it is negligible in Belgium. The **passenger mobility** is expressed in **passenger-kilometers [pkm]** for each year and includes commuting, leisure, and other mobility needs. The **passenger mobility intensity** reports the passenger mobility over the population and is expressed in **passenger-kilometers per person [pkm/person]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate passenger mobility statistics for the reference year (2019), we rely on two main sources: (i) the JRC-IDEES database, whose most recent figures date from 2023 [1,2], and (ii) the two most recent Belgian Federal Mobility Surveys, conducted in 2017 and over the period 2024–2025 [3,4]. These two sources are complementary, as the former excludes data related to active modes (walking, cycling), while the latter focuses on daily commuting within Belgium and excludes extra-territorial trips, aviation being the main representative. Although not strictly required to assess the final energy consumption of the transport sector, gentle active modes are key levers in a transition based on sufficiency. As they help illustrate their contribution to reducing the sector’s energy consumption, they are therefore included in this notebook.\n",

    "Excluding gentle modes, from 2000 to 2019, the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+780 pkm/person*, which is equivalent +5.5% [1,2]. This is driven by aviation (intra and extra Europe), which has grown by about *+1160 pkm/person* (or +8.1% w.r.t. total mobility intensity), and also due to rail (passenger trains and urban light rails) which has grown by about *+340 pkm/person/year* (or +2.4% w.r.t. total mobility intensity). In the meantime, road (two-wheeelers, cars and buses) has decreased by about *-720 pkm/person* (or -5.0% w.r.t. total mobility intensity) [1,2].\n",
    "For its part, the Federal Planning Bureau, excluding aviation but including active modes, estimates that from 1990 to 2019 the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+1830 pkm/person* [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this increase in the mobility intensity for the past 30 years, we believe this trend can be reversed, notably because of the expansion of teleworking [5], and through a higher share of urban housing and a prioritisation of closer tourist destinations. Population ageing and increased transportation costs should also reduce the mobility intensity [5]. This reversed trend assumption is further supported by the fact that the Federal Planning Bureau estimates that, under unchanged policies and excluding aviation from the projection, mobility intensity could decrease by around *-100 pkm/person* by 2040 [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this, we project a **-10% reduction** in global **mobility intensity** by **2050** w.r.t. the 2019 level. This -10% assumption leads to an estimated **14.381 pkm/person** by 2050 (*-1.598 pkm/person*).\n",
    "We attribute a significant share of this reduction (around half of it) to a decrease in the number of long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible and whose decarbonisation remains uncertain (limited availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), etc.).

    "By 2019, 58,8% of all passenger-kilometres were made by car while 19,9% were by plane. The remaining 21,3% were shared among public transport, cycling, walking, and other modes. Cars (with an average occupancy rate of 1,20 [3,4] - 1,22 [1,2]) and aviation together thus accounted for nearly 80% of total passenger-kilometres in 2019. As these modes of transport are also the most energy-intensive and therefore the most greenhouse-gas-emitting, it is essential to promote modal shift whenever possible, and to limit their use when not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although fossil-fuelled cars are gradually being replaced by battery electric vehicles, we believe that a fair transition should limit reliance on this individual mode of transport. Replacing all internal combustion engine cars with electric cars and without any modal shift does not seem desirable for several reasons, the main ones being (i) the pressure on raw materials (some of which are critical and also needed for other clean technologies) and (ii) the very large land footprint of car-based mobility, particularly in urban areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to aviation, we believe that short-haul flights should shift towards less energy-intensive modes of transport wherever possible. The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) should be prioritised for long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible. Nevertheless, due to the limited availability and potential of SAF, as well as the technological and economic challenges of alternative propulsion systems (batteries, hydrogen, etc.), a reduction in very long-distance travel appears essential to reduce the overall environmental footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore set an overall objective of **reducing** the individual demand for **extra-Europe flights** by **-40%**, and of achieving a **modal shift** for **50%** of the **intra-Europe flights** towards **international train services**. Regarding **passenger cars**, we aim at a **modal shift** for **30%** of the **displacements** and an increased adoption of **carpooling**. More details are provided below.\n",

    "    Assuming a round trip to a destination 9.000 km away (such as Brussels–Shanghai or Brussels–Los Angeles), i.e. 18.000 km in total, and using 2019 data (20.715 Gpkm of long-haul flights [1,2]), we can infer that about 150.0833 people could have made such a trip in that year, i.e. exactly 10% of the population. If the total volume of long-haul flights were reduced by -40% by 2050, decreasing to 12,429 Gpkm, then only about 690.500 people could make such a trip, i.e. about 5.5% of the population. Looked at from another perspective, for the same overall mobility budget, the entire Belgian population could make such a trip roughly once every 18 years, i.e. nearly five times over a lifetime. This target of a 40% reduction in long-haul flights therefore appears both realistic and socially acceptable.\r\n",

In its 'Vision Rail 2040' policy note published in 2022, the Belgian Minister of Mobility, Georges Gilkinet, stated the objective of increasing the modal share of rail from 8% to 15% by 2040 (aviation excluded) [7]. Few quantitative details are provided; however, assuming that conventional rail intensity was 919 pkm/person in 2019 [7], doubling the modal share would bring this value to around 1.840 pkm/person by 2040. In light of the performance observed in neighbouring countries, this appears achievable through an increase in service supply, without necessarily expanding network density. The projected value of 1.882 pkm/person in 2050 for conventional rail is therefore fully consistent with the stated ambition.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Comment:** It should be noted that, in its business-as-usual outlook, the Belgian Federal Planning Bureau [5] estimates that total rail demand would decrease by 2,8%. Our assumption of more than doubling rail demand therefore requires strong public policies.*\n",

This share remains confidential but could increase for applications where range is a key issue (such as coaches) and due to logistical constraints (limited access to charging infrastructure, charging times). Several manufacturers are developing solutions in this area (see Irizar i6S Efficient Hydrogen and Daimler-Setra H2 Coach). Nevertheless, given the already high ranges exceeding 600 km offered by electric coaches (see Volvo BZR Electric and MAN Lion’s Coach E), it is also very likely that battery electric coaches will dominate over hydrogen in the future.\r\n",

As no trolleybus projects (with or without onboard batteries) are currently being discussed in Belgium, this option is not considered. Regarding hydrogen, the outlook is highly uncertain due to competition with battery electric solutions and the difficulties in scaling up the hydrogen value chain. We nevertheless assume a 5% share by 2050. For the remaining share, we assume that gasoline-powered drivetrains will completely disappear. We also retain a small 3% share for liquid-fuel propulsion, considering that biodiesel could facilitate the use of locally produced energy while enabling longer-distance operations. Similarly, we allocate a 2% share to gas-powered vehicles, assuming the potential valorisation of biogas.orisation of biogas."

Consequently, most of the vehicle fleet in 2050 should consist of battery-powered vehicles. We nevertheless retain a small share (1,5% each) for diesel, gasoline, and gas engines, as these could potentially be fueled with renewable fuels (biofuels, or even e-fuels). We however exclude hydrogen, as current prospects do not appear favorable for this drivetrain.\r\n",

    "We aim for a gradual phase-out of gasoline and diesel engines, reaching a combined floor value of 3% by 2050. Given current trends, which point to a rapid decline of diesel (-3,1%/year of total shares), likely reinforced by the Dieselgate scandal, its minimum share of 1,5% should be reached by 2040. Gasoline gradually replaces diesel during the transition, although the total share of internal combustion engines continues to decline. \r\n",

    "The rail operator SNCB has committed not to renewing its AR41 diesel railcars. The main barrier to fully replacing them with electric traction remains the lack of electrification of just under 10% of the network, mainly around Ghent (Eeklo–Ronse, Ghent–Geraardsbergen, Aalst–Burst) and on the Charleroi–Couvin line. Full electrification of the network appears to be the most appropriate solution for phasing out diesel, even if it is also the most costly one [8]. The limited use of battery-electric trains also appears to be an interesting option when direct electrification is not possible. The hydrogen train option is set aside due to high operational costs. In the scenarios studied by Transport & Mobility Leuven, full electrification could be achieved by 2035, provided that appropriate policies are implemented [8]. We therefore propose to set a target of **100% electrification** by **2035** (direct catenary + battery)."

While Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)-which are renewable (bio-based and synthetic) drop-in substitutes for conventional jet fuel-appear to be the most straightforward option, their real global potential remains uncertain, notably due to competing uses (land use, biomass availability).\r\n",

These options nevertheless represent a considerable technical challenge, both in terms of adapting propulsion systems and in terms of fuel storage capacity and safety (energy density, flammability risks, toxicity, pollution managemec.), as well as the required adaptation of airport infrastructure. Although the aviation sector has stated its ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, projects involving alternative propulsion aircraft are facing delays. For example, Airbus’s ZEROe project, which aimed to bring short-haul a hydrogen-powered aircraft with a capacity of 100 passengers and a range  1,850 km into service by 2035, has recently been postponed by 5 to 10 years, and its budget has been reduced.\r\n",

These 13% attributed to new aircraft technologies therefore represent only a limited contribution, which likely also reflects a lack of confidence in their large-scale deployment.\r\n",

This huge discrepency (+60% for JRC-IDEES) should be further investigated! This could be due to the fact that Statbel only considers 1ton+ vehicles registered in Belgium.

Gross tonnage includes both the weight of the rolling stock (locomotive, wagons, container carriers, etc.) and the weight of the transported goods (including the weight of the container in the case of container transport). The Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport gives 14,70385 Gtkm (https://mobilit.belgium.be/fr/mobilite-durable/enquetes-et-resultats/chiffres-cles-de-la-mobilite, data from Infrabel), which corresponds to the value re While we get a modal share of 18,3%, the Vision Rail report claim that it was 12,1% (from Eurostat, https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tran_hv_frmod/default/table) [7]. Knowing that they exlude aviation, this is even less when compared to our data. The difference might come from Gtkm by truck. The Federal Planning Bureau gives 6,5 Gtkm [5]. This is much less than JRC-IDEES! The difference should be further investigated.*\r\n",

    "By 2019, 58.8% of all passenger-kilometres were made by car while 19.9% were by plane. The remaining 21.3% were shared among public transport, cycling, walking, and other modes. Cars (with an average occupancy rate of 1,2 [3,4]) and aviation together thus accounted for nearly 80% of total passenger-kilometres in 2019. As these modes of transport are also the most energy-intensive and therefore the most greenhouse-gas-emitting, it is essential to promote modal shift whenever possible, and to limit their use when not.<br>\n",
    "Although fossil-fuelled cars are gradually being replaced by battery electric vehicles, we believe that a fair transition should limit reliance on this individual mode of transport. Replacing all internal combustion engine cars with electric cars without any modal shift does not seem desirable for several reasons, the main ones being (i) the pressure on raw materials (some of which are critical and also needed for other clean technologies) and (ii) the very large land footprint of car-based mobility, particularly in urban areas.<br>\n",
    "With regard to aviation, we believe that short-haul flights should shift towards less energy-intensive modes of transport wherever possible. The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) should be prioritised for long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible. Nevertheless, due to the limited availability and potential of SAF, as well as the technological and economic challenges of alternative propulsion systems (batteries, hydrogen, etc.), a reduction in very long-distance travel appears essential to reduce the overall environmental footprint.<br>\n",
    "We therefore set an overall objective of **reducing** the individual demand for **extra-Europe flights** by **-40%**, and of achieving a **modal shift** for **50%** of the **intra-Europe flights** towards **international train services**. Regarding **passenger cars**, we aim at a **modal shift** for **30%** of the **displacements** and an increased adoption of **carpooling**. More details are provided below."
