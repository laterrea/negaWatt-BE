    "* $\\textcolor{Orange}{\\textbf{Energy Sufficiency}}$ refers to a reduction in the demand for energy-intensive transport activities. It is achieved through behavioral and systemic changes that avoid or reduce car use, including modal shifts and shared mobility.\n",

    "Passenger mobility is measured by the total annual distance travelled, representing the total number of kilometers covered each year by the population across all transport modes. In this study, only navigation is excluded, as it is negligible in Belgium. The passenger mobility is expressed in passenger-kilometers per year (pkm/year) and includes commuting, leisure, and other mobility needs. The passenger mobility intensity reports the passenger mobility over the population and is expressed in passenger-kilometers per person per year (pkm/person/year).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate passenger mobility statistics for the reference year (2019), we rely on two main sources: (i) the JRC-IDEES database, whose most recent figures date from 2023 [1,2], and (ii) the two most recent Belgian Federal Mobility Surveys, conducted in 2017 and over the period 2024–2025 [3,4]. These two sources are complementary, as the former excludes data related to active modes (walking, cycling), while the latter focus on daily commuting within Belgium and exclude extra-territorial trips, aviation being the main representative. Although not strictly required to assess the energy consumption of the transport sector, genlte active modes are key components of a transition based on sufficiency. As they help illustrate their contribution to reducing the sector’s energy demand, they are therefore included in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2019, JRC-IDEES [1,2] reports a value of *172,657 Gpkm* covering mobility by road, rail and air. Based on reports from the Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport [3,4], we estimate that in the same year additional contributions amounted at *7,000 Gpkm* for cycling and *3,000 Gpkm* for walking.\n",

This is about -0.1% deviation, which is more than acceptable! But regarding train, the Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport gives 17,357 Gpkm [3] while IDEES gives 10,364 Gpkm [1,2]. This is about -40% deviation. The origin of this discrepency should be further investigated!*\n",

    "> ***Comment:** Data for cycling and walking should be refined. The Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport (christophe.pauwels@mobilit.fgov.be) has told us that estimates for 2024-2025 are: 7,2 Gpkm for cycling an 4 Gpkm for walking.*\n",

    "Excluding gentle modes, from 2000 to 2019, the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+780 pkm/person/year* (or +5.5%) [1,2]. This is driven by aviation (intra and extra Europe), which has grown by about *+1160 pkm/person/year* (or +8.1% w.r.t. total individual annual distance travelled), and also due to rail (passenger trains and urban light rails) which has grown by about *+340 pkm/person/year* (or +2.4% w.r.t. total individual annual distance travelled), while road (two-wheeelers, cars and buses) has decreased by about *-720 pkm/person/year* (or -5.0% w.r.t. total individual annual distance travelled) [1,2].\n",
    "For its part, the Federal Planning Bureau, excluding aviation but including active modes, estimates that from 1990 to 2019 the total mobility intensity has grown by about *+1830 pkm/person/year*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this +5.5% increase in the mobility intensity from 2000 to 2019, we believe this trend can be reversed, notably because of the expansion of teleworking [5], and through a higher share of urban housing and a prioritisation of closer tourist destinations. Population ageing and increased transportation costs should also reduce the mobility intensity [5]. This reversed trend assumption is further supported by the fact that the Federal Planning Bureau estimates that, under unchanged policies and excluding aviation from the projection, mobility intensity could decrease by around *-100 pkm/person/year* by 2040 (approximately −0.7%) [5].<br> \n",
    "In light of this, we project a **-10% reduction** in total mobility intensity by 2050 w.r.t. the 2019 level. Our -15% assumption leads to an estimated **14.381 pkm/person/year** by 2050 (-1.598 pkm/person/year).\n",
    "We attribute a significant share of this reduction (around half of it) to a decrease in the number of long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible and whose decarbonisation remains uncertain (limited availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), complex changes to the powertrain, etc.). More details are provided below.\n"

    "> ***Comment:** Data for cycling and walking should be refined. The Belgian Federal Public Service for Mobility and Transport (christophe.pauwels@mobilit.fgov.be) has told us that estimates for 2024-2025 are: 7,2 Gpkm for cycling an 4 Gpkm for walking.*\n",

    "By 2019, 58.8% of all passenger-kilometres were made by car while 19.9% were by plane. The remaining 21.3% were shared among public transport, cycling, walking, and other modes. Cars (with an average occupancy rate of around 1,2 [3,4]) and aviation together thus accounted for nearly 80% of total passenger-kilometres in 2019. As these modes of transport are also the most energy-intensive and therefore the most greenhouse-gas-emitting, it is essential to promote modal shift whenever possible and to limit their use when not.<br>\n",
    "Although fossil-fuelled cars are gradually being replaced by battery electric vehicles, we believe that a fair transition should limit reliance on this individual mode of transport. Replacing all internal combustion engine cars with electric cars without any modal shift does not seem desirable for several reasons, the main ones being (i) the pressure on raw materials (some of which are critical and also needed for other clean technologies) and (ii) the very large land footprint of car-based mobility, particularly in urban areas.<br>\n",
    "With regard to aviation, we believe that short-haul flights should shift towards less energy-intensive modes of transport wherever possible. The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) should be prioritised for long-haul flights, for which modal shift is hardly feasible. Nevertheless, due to the limited availability and potential of SAF, as well as the technological and economic challenges of alternative propulsion systems (batteries, hydrogen, etc.), a reduction in very long-distance travel appears essential to reduce the overall environmental footprint.<br>\n",
    "We therefore set an overall objective of **reducing demand** for **long-haul flights** by **-40%**, and of achieving **modal shift** for **50%** of the **short-haul flights** towards **international train services**. Regarding **passenger cars**, we aim at a **modal shift** for **30%** of the **displacements** and an increased adoption of **carpooling**. More details are provided below.\n",

    "    <strong>Note:</strong> Assuming a round trip to a destination 9.000 km away (such as Brussels–Shanghai or Brussels–Los Angeles), i.e. 18.000 km in total, and using 2019 data (20.715 Gpkm of long-haul flights [1,2]), we can infer that about 1.1500833 people could have made such a trip in that year, i.e. exactly 10% of the population. \n",
    "    If the total volume of long-haul flights were reduced by -40% by 2050, decreasing to 12,429 Gpkm, then only about 690.500 people could make such a trip, i.e. about 5.5% of the population. \n",
    "    Looked at from another perspective, for the same overall mobility budget, the entire Belgian population could make such a trip roughly once every 18 years, i.e. nearly five times over a lifetime. This target of a 40% reduction in long-haul flights therefore appears both realistic and socially acceptable.e.\r\n",

However, in the case of cars, the situation is different: the 2050 projections are based on estimated values for 2019, which themselves were derived from 2015 data. Now that updated JRC statistics are available up to 2021, it’s clear that the 2019 estimates used as a baseline for cars are inaccurate. To stay aligned with the rest of the analysis (which begins in 2019), the 2015 values are not displayed here, but this also highlights the need to revise the entire car breakdown using the most recent data.\n",
