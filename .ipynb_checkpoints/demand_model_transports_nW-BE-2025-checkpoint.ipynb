    "- **Tram/metro**: It is assumed that there will be a slight increase from 0.95% to 1.20%.\n",
    "> **Comment**: This may be a conservative estimate. Given the development of new tram lines in Liège and other cities, a higher increase could be expected, particularly if coordinated with upgrades to other modes of public transport.\n",
    "- **Train**: The train share is projected to double, from 7.30% to 14.00%. This aligns with national strategies, such as Vision Rail 2040 [6]. The Minister of Transports targets a modal share of 15% by 2040 for trains, excluding gentle modes. When walking and cycling are included, this equates to around 13%, which lends weight to the plausibility of our target of 14% by 2050. \n",

    "- **Motorcycle**: Its share rises from 1.30% to 3.50%, which is more than double. This could be due to an increased use of two-wheelers for commuting in urban and peri-urban areas, particularly given the growing availability of low-emission or electric models.\n",
    "- **Bus/coach**: The share doubles from 9.00% to 18.00%. This growth is considered plausible if rural and suburban areas are served by an expanded network of high-frequency bus services.\n",
    "- **Car**: As a direct consequence of the increases in all other modes, the car modal share drops from 74.75% in 2019 to 48.30% in 2050, representing a 35% reduction.\n",

Now that updated JRC statistics are available up to 2021, it’s clear that the 2019 estimates used as a baseline for cars are inaccurate. To stay aligned with the rest of the analysis (which begins in 2019), the 2015 values are not displayed here, but this also highlights the need to revise the entire car breakdown using the most recent data.\n",

    "Both breakdowns refer to the same total share of road freight and cannot be added together.

LCVs remain dominant for short urban deliveries and are considered to be a constant factor.\n",

This approach differs from the actual JRC figures.\n",

The projected rise of hydrogen trucks (32.4%) is more realistic for long-distance freight, assuming strong policy support and infrastructure. However, a 30% market share for electric trucks seems high given that batteries take up a lot of space and reduce payload capacity. It’s also surprising that hybrid trucks aren’t considered here, as they could play an important role during the transition.\n",
    "> **Note:** More than half of freight truck activity is international (from/to NL, FR, DE), which limits the impact of national policy on technology choices and fleet transition."
